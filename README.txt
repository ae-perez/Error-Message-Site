Personal Portfolio

My portfolio has, and is, a spiffy new blog/magazine style responsive site template with a flat/minimal design aesthetic. I used many components from: Dopetrope by HTML5 UP html5up.net | @ajlkn

which are free templates for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)

please make sure to check them out! :D

also please give me feedback on how I can better, my website. I'll be trying to update this site as much as possible!
